//First of all let’s plug our smartphone to the USB port of our computer and get a list of the installed packages and their namespaces:

adb shell pm list packages
//This will list all packages on your smartphone, once you’ve found the namespace of the package you want to reverse ( com.android.systemui in this example ), let’s see what its physical path is:


Get the full path name of the APK file for the desired package.

adb shell pm path com.example.someapp

The output will look something like this: package:/data/app/com.example.someapp-2.apk

Pull the APK file from the Android device to the development box.

adb pull /data/app/com.example.someapp-2.apk
