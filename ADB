//First of all let’s plug our smartphone to the USB port of our computer and get a list of the installed packages and their namespaces:

adb shell pm list packages
//This will list all packages on your smartphone, once you’ve found the namespace of the package you want to reverse ( com.android.systemui in this example ), let’s see what its physical path is:

adb shell pm path com.android.systemui
//Finally, we have the APK path:

package:/system/priv-app/SystemUIGoogle/SystemUIGoogle.apk
//Let’s pull it from the device:

adb pull /system/priv-app/SystemUIGoogle/SystemUIGoogle.apk
//And here you go, you have the APK you want to reverse!
